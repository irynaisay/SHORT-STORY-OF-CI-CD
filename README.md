# SHORT-STORY-OF-CI-CD
## CI and CD, the two mysterious abbreviations: What is behind them? Let’s first decode the meaning

CI stands for **“continuous integration”** and CD goes for **“continuous development”**. At their core, we find the “continuity” that embodies the entire culture or, in common terms, a collection of principles for devops teams that allow delivering changes in codes continually.

Modern applications are used at many various platforms and tools. Thus, devops teams do need an approach or a mechanism to integrate and validate changes once there is a need to conquer new environments. What is more, the scale of such changes may be massive which tangles the deployment.

However, the CI/CD is more than just a set of practices. It is a pipeline, the end-to-end process, for conveying tasks and driving a mass of changes to perform better, faster and smoother and meet customers’ expectations.

Let’s split the twins and see what their roles are: CI and CD.

**Let’s unpack CI**

As one of the CI/CD’s Gurus, Martin Fowler, said: “Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.” Source: [martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html).

At the centre of development lifecycle, there is an integration process. Once devops teams checked a code at private spaces, the changes may be committed to a repository. This process can be repeated continuously, so the devops teams stay devoted to continuous early detection and solution of problems.

Just few advantages to name here: early detection of bugs allowing reducing the count of bugs; automation of the entire process with enhanced transparency; and the last but not the least is the cost-effective performance.

**Now it’s turn for CD**

As we see from the abbreviation, it is the “delivery” that takes the turn. In fact, it is an extension of CI. This very process is aimed at releasing your product and satisfying your customers entirely.

Again, Mr. Martin Fowler advices us: “Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time.” Source: [martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html)

Another few advantages to add: reduces the risks, so deployment will be faster and smoother; the quality of application is improved; the costs will be reduced, and the team is happier with much better product in hands.

This treasure throve is a tool that helps making smaller changes more frequently and reliably and at massive scales. Of course, there are barriers to consider, such as costs and culture. However, this mechanism, or better say, philosophy, is well worth a look at it. In addition, there are many good build and deployment pipelines to use in-house and in-cloud to pick from the market. It is never too late to learn!
